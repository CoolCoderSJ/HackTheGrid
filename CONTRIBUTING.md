- The main branch is protected. You need to make a pull request to merge your changes.
- Each pull request **must** state what it has changed and why.
- Each pull request **must** be reviewed by at least one other person before it can be merged.

If you need any help making a pull request, let me know and I'll help you out.

Do **not** drastically change the codebase or remove any libraries unless it is necessary or helps further the project. Do not drastically redesign the website either.
