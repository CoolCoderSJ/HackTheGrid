The code consists of a simple HTML website with no backend. 

If you'd like to run it locally, you can do so with a local file server such as `python -m http.server` or something similar.

if you need any help with this, let me know. opening the file directly in your browser may not work due to absolute paths.

The files run on Vercel.

What's used:
- DaisyUI (tailwindcss)
- AnimateCSS
- IonIcons
- Typekit (Adobe Fonts)
